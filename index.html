            They say nobody is perfect, but the way you love me is pretty close.
            Looking back at 2025, I honestly don't know how I would have
            finished my thesis or survived that graduation madness without you.
            You were my rock when things got tough, fixing every problem and
            making sure I shined.

            You’re only 23, but you protect me and provide for my heart like a
            man twice your age. I’m so proud of the man you are today, and I’m
            even more excited for the man you’re becoming. I don’t just want to
            be here for the good times; I want to be the woman right next to you
            when you get that first job, that first car, and all the success
            coming your way.

            Thank you for choosing me every day. I hope everytime you scan this
            and read it, you’ll be reminded that there’s someone so proud of you
            and love you beyond your human imaginations. I love you more than
            words can say. Here’s to forever Nyuntine.
